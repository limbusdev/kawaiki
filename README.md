# Kawaiki Icon Theme

![](./choose-your-side.png)

## Introduction

Hello, I am happy, that you found my Icon-Theme. I put lots of work into it. It's still far from perfect, but made great progress during the last year. I know, nowadays people like flat, tile-like icons with consistent looks. Consistency really matters, but I just wanted to create a beautiful icon theme which meets the criteria of being consistent, but still giving you unique beauty with great detail for your desktop. I hope you like it, as much as I do and don't hesitate to comment, if you have any problems with it ;)

## Thanks

Go to all the artists out there, who inspired me with their beautiful works. Especially the creator of the Faenza and Faience Icon Themes, who brought us a new level of beauty on the linux desktop.
I also loved the Human Folder Icons in Ubuntu Jaunty and never understood, why they changed them.


## Installing

Installing Kwaiki Icon Theme ist straight forward. If you want the theme to be available for all users of your PC,
copy all Kawaiki folders to `/usr/share/icons`.
If you want it to be available only for yourself, copy to `~/.icons` (in your `home` directory).

The easiest way of installing is by using the script. It will lead you through the process
and will edit the themes files to go smootheley with your chosen GTK+ theme.

Just run `./INSTALL.sh` from the command line, within the Kawaiki-Icon-Theme folder.
Run as root to install for all users.
